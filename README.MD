### What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud"). These services include:

- **Storage**: Saving and retrieving data.
- **Processing**: Running applications and performing computations.
- **Networking**: Connecting different systems and applications.

Instead of owning physical hardware and software, users can rent computing resources from cloud providers (like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and access them online.

**Example**: When you use Google Drive to store files, you're using cloud storage. You don't need to buy a physical hard drive; Google provides the storage space and manages it for you.

### How Do We Know if Something is in the Cloud?

Something is in the cloud if it can be accessed and used over the internet without being stored locally on your device. 

**Indicators**:
1. **Internet Access**: You need an internet connection to access it.
2. **No Local Storage**: The data or application isn't stored on your personal device but on remote servers.
3. **URL Access**: Often accessed through a web browser or specific apps.

**Example**: 
- Using Gmail for email instead of Outlook installed on your computer.
- Streaming movies on Netflix instead of watching them from a DVD.

mycomment : first, you need internet. 
if you find files or any documents that you uploaded is found in cloud but not stored in your local machine,
We can consider as they are in cloud.

### Differences Between On-Prem and the Cloud

**On-Prem (On-Premises)**:
- **Location**: Servers and infrastructure are located on the company’s physical site.
- **Control**: Full control over hardware and software configurations.
- **Cost**: Higher upfront cost for purchasing and maintaining hardware.
- **Scalability**: Limited by the physical hardware; scaling up requires buying more equipment.
- **Maintenance**: Company’s IT team is responsible for managing and maintaining everything.

**Cloud**:
- **Location**: Servers and infrastructure are located in remote data centers managed by cloud providers.
- **Control**: Less direct control over hardware but easier management through provider tools.
- **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go model; you pay for what you use, which can be more cost-effective.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable; you can quickly add or remove resources based on need.
- **Maintenance**: Cloud provider handles hardware maintenance and updates.

**Example**:
- **On-Prem**: A company runs its own email server in its office.
- **Cloud**: The same company uses Microsoft Office 365 for email, which is hosted by Microsoft in the cloud.

By understanding these basic concepts, you can better grasp how modern computing works and why businesses might choose one option over the other. 


### 4 Deployment Models of Cloud Computing

1. **Private Cloud**:
   - **Definition**: A cloud environment operated exclusively for a single organization.
   - **How It Works**: Managed either internally or by a third party, with resources dedicated solely to one organization.
   - **Use Case**: Companies with strict security, compliance, or regulatory requirements.
   - **Example**: A large corporation with sensitive data uses a private cloud for better control and security.

2. **Public Cloud**:
   - **Definition**: Cloud services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
   - **How It Works**: Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and shared among multiple customers.
   - **Use Case**: Startups and businesses looking for cost-effective, scalable solutions without managing physical infrastructure.
   - **Example**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

3. **Hybrid Cloud**:
   - **Definition**: A combination of private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
   - **How It Works**: Enables data and applications to move between private and public clouds, offering greater flexibility and more deployment options.
   - **Use Case**: Businesses that need to balance sensitive data handling with cost-effective, scalable public cloud services.
   - **Example**: A company uses a private cloud for sensitive data and a public cloud for less-sensitive applications.

4. **Multi-Cloud**:
   - **Definition**: The use of multiple cloud computing services from different providers.
   - **How It Works**: Organizations use services from various cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in, enhance performance, or leverage specific services.

   - **Definition**: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
   - **How It Works**: Includes hardware and software tools available over the internet, such as development frameworks, databases, and servers.
   - **Example**: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
   - **Definition**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
   - **How It Works**: Users access applications via a web browser; the provider manages the infrastructure, platforms, and software.
   - **Example**: Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce.
